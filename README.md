## Simple slider

Slider works as follows:

- Images are taken from the arrayImage variable and we embed them into the layout through a for loop
- The sliderLeft and sliderRight functions move the “slider” element horizontally.
- From line 21 to 29, we check the screen size and, in accordance with the condition, change the shift variable, which we will use as a value in the sliderLeft and sliderRight functions. Also in the condition we set the maximum width of the "slider" element
